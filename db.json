        "Privacy campaigners and doctors have raised the alarm about plans, led by the Department of Health and Social Care, to put the medical histories of more than 55 million patients into a new database where they will be made available to the private sector and other researchers.",
        "NHS Digital has said the new General Practice Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) system will reduce the burden on GP practices and create a valuable data source for pharmaceutical and public policy research. The agency says the data, which will include information on patients’ physical, mental and sexual health, will be anonymised.",
        "But critics warn anonymisation can be easily reversed. And they argue the six weeks between the announcement of the plan and the beginning of collection has not given patients enough time to understand what is happening to their medical records."
